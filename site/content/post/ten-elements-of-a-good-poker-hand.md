# Elements of a Hand

A hand in no-limit hold ’em has many facets, only one of which is the cards you hold.  This might seem like a lot of things to consider before making a play. Actually, it is a lot! That's why playing no-limit hold ’em well is difficult but rewarding. If this were a short list, the game would be much easier, more people would do it well, and fewer players would make any real money. So if your goal is to become a top no-limit hold ’em player, be glad that it's a tough, rather than an easy thing to do. That just means your hard work will be well rewarded. Here are the basic elements:

## 1.) What's the status of the tournament?

 Most tournaments pay prizes to about 5-10 percent of the field, although a few pay much less. (One notable tournament in 2003 paid nine places out of 197 entries, which is about as tough a payout structure as I've ever seen.) As long as the cut-off point for prize payouts is distant, play proceeds normally. As the number of players shrinks and gets close to the prize cutoff, play changes dramatically. Most players turn conservative and try to preserve their chips. Good players become more aggressive and see this period as the best chance to make some easy money by stealing chips. 



## 2.) How many players are at your table?

A full table (9-10 players) requires generally tighter play. The more people there are to act behind you, the greater the danger in moving at the pot with a weak hand. At a short table (6 players or less), hand requirements shrink and there's much more opportunity to pilfer pots. At the end of a tournament, when the table has shrunk to just two, three, or four players, you'll need to be involved in many more pots than usual just to have a chance to stay alive. 



## 3.) Who are the players at your table?

 Are they aggressive players, conservative players, or a mix of the two? Are there name players with known styles, or are the players all unknowns? The most profitable style to play at any moment is usually the opposite of the style of the other players at the table. If the table is aggressive, be conservative. Enter pots only with solid hands that you can play with confidence. If the table is tight, move out and try to steal a few pots. You'll get away with it often enough to make money. The character of the players at your table also determines how slow or fast you want to play. A table with a lot of passive players is a comfortable table. You want to stick around, steal pots, and accumulate money slowly, but surely. It's a good situation, and you don't want to risk it with a lot of all-in bets. But if the table has a lot of aggressive players, your strategy has to change. Aggressive players are harder to read, and you'll find that your raises are getting reraised frequently. Now you'll often want to make money in one full swoop, since otherwise you'll be whittled down, and it's hard to make any money with a small stack at an aggressive table. Pick a good hand and be prepared to go all the way with it. 



## 4.) How does your stack compare to the blinds and antes?

You don't actually care about the absolute size of the blinds and antes. What's important is their size relative to your stack of chips. If they're tiny compared to your stack, then you can survive many rounds without playing, so you're under no pressure to enter pots. If, however, your stack is just a few times larger than the blinds and antes, then you have to move quickly or the blinds will gobble you up. In no-limit hold ’em tournaments, the blinds and antes increase on a regular basis. Unless you can accumulate chips steadily, your stack size will steadily shrink in relative terms, and your play has to become more aggressive to compensate. 



## 5.) How big are the other stacks at your table?

If you have a large stack compared to the other players, then you can probably bully them around. You have the power to eliminate them completely from the tournament, so they have to give you respect. If your stack is in the middle of the pack, you can still bully the smallest stacks, but you have to be careful about tangling with the bigger stacks. If you have the smallest stack, your ability to steal pots is limited. You'll have to pick a spot and try to double or triple up. 



## 5.) Where do you sit in relation to the aggressive and passive players?

 Since action proceeds clockwise around the table, your ideal situation is to have the aggressive players on your right, the conservative players on your left. That way, you act with knowledge of what the aggressive players have done, and your pot-stealing chances are enhanced when you have tight players reacting to you. With aggressive players sitting behind you, the right strategy is to play fewer hands, but play them more decisively. 

## 6.) What bets have been made in front of you?

 The only absolutely strong hand before the flop is a pair of aces. All other hands have to be evaluated in terms of the betting that has already occurred. A pair of jacks is a good hand when several players in front of you have folded, but if you're facing bet-raise-reraise, it's likely to be second-or third-best. 



## 7.) How many active players are left after you act?

 If your action potentially ends the betting on the hand, you're in a more secure position than if active players will remain behind you no matter what you do. If for instance, you are last to act and the betting in front of you has been bet and call, then you can shut down the action by calling. If however, the action has been bet and raise, then you can't end the action no matter what you do. Either a call or a raise can be answered by a reraise from the first player. You have to play much more cautiously when you can't be sure of the action behind you. The more potential action, the more cautiously you play. 



## 8.) What are the pot odds?

When making a bet, you are always comparing the odds offered by the pot to the odds of making your hand. You always want the pot to offer you better odds than the odds of filling the hand you're drawing to. You're also watching the odds you are giving to your opponent as he tries to make his hand, to see if you can deny him the odds he needs to call. Top players calculate pot odds routinely when deciding whether to play or fold. 



## 9.) What is your position at the table after the flop?

 It's bad to act first in a hand, because you have to act with no new information about your opponents. It's good to act last, because you get to see what your opponents have done, hence gaining information, before you have to make a decision. Your position at the table, relative to the other players, is a hugely important feature of every hand, one that good players understand instinctively and poor players overlook. Position is so important that players will make moves just to secure favorable position on subsequent betting rounds. Before the flop, you might reraise instead of merely calling, just to chase players sitting behind you out of the hand. Marginal hands might be played if you know you will have position on other players, but folded if you won't. Here's an example of just how important position can be. If a world-class player were to play a heads-up session against a player of mediocre skills, but the lessor player could act last every hand, the world-class player would have the worst of it.



## 10.) And last but not the least, what are your cards?

Yes, you do actually have cards, and they do matter. But so do all these other aspects of a hand, and in many hands they matter more than your cards. You will sometimes find yourself in situations where you'll make a play regardless of the cards in your hand.

Playing good poker is a matter of balance. You look over the situation, weigh all the factors, and find the move that strikes just the right note. As in many competitive occupations, you can play very well for awhile, believe that you have mastered the game, and then get subtly out of synch, and find that your results have deteriorated, even though you feel you're playing as well as ever. When that happens there's no recourse but to be ruthlessly determined and objective until you put the puzzle back together again.
